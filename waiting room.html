Hospital facility was huge, with endless corridors. Sterile white walls, blue doors, everywhere. These corridors were familiar from many years. Ever since childhood.

Waiting areas also hadn't changed. Seats, old TV running the same soap opera reruns. One thing had changed though. Nowadays people did their doctor times remotely, as technology had progressed quite a bit. So, waiting area was quiet. No one was there, except him. Nowadays people came to hospital if they needed special treatment.

As usual, doctors were, late. How could they be behind the schedule, when nurse said on the voice call few days ago, that there weren't other patients today?

Time passed. Waiting felt like an eternity, until one of the blue doors opened and a tall man in long white coat stepped out.

"Kaira!" that man shouted.
