    Hospital facility was huge, with endless corridors. 
    <br>
    Sterile white walls, blue doors, everywhere. 
    <br>
    These corridors were familiar from many years, 
    <span onclick="currentSlide(2)">ever since childhood.</span>
    </div>

    <div class="mySlides">
    Waiting areas also hadn't changed. 
    <br>
    Seats, old TV running the same soap opera reruns. 
    <br>
    One thing had changed though. 
    <br>Nowadays people did their doctor times remotely, as technology had progressed quite a bit. 
    <br>So, waiting area was quiet.  
        <span onclick="currentSlide(3)">
        No one was there, except him.

    As usual, doctors were, late.
    <br>
    How could they be behind the schedule, when nurse said on the voice call few days ago, that 
        <span onclick="currentSlide(4)">there weren't other patients today?

    <div class="mySlides">
    Time passed. 
    <br>
    Waiting felt like an eternity, <span onclick="currentSlide(5)">until one of the blue doors opened and a tall man in long white coat stepped out.
    </span>   
    </div>

    <div class="mySlides" id="yell-id">
    "Kaira!" that man shouted.

            <span onclick="currentSlide(1)">Click to wait...</span>
