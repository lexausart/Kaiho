    <div id="slide1">
    Hospital facility was huge, with endless corridors. 
    <br>
    Sterile white walls, blue doors, everywhere. 
    <br>
    These corridors were familiar from many years, 
    <span>ever since childhood.</span>
    </div>

    <div id="slide2">
    Waiting areas also hadn't changed. 
    <br>
    Seats, old TV running the same soap opera reruns. 
    <br>
    One thing had changed though. 
    <br>Nowadays people did their doctor times remotely, as technology had progressed quite a bit. 
    <br>So, waiting area was quiet.  
    <span>
    No one was there, except him.
    </span>
    </div>

    <div id="slide3">
    As usual, doctors were, late.
    <br>
    How could they be behind the schedule, when nurse said on the voice call few days ago, that 
    <span>there weren't other patients today?
    </span>    
    </div>

    <div id="slide4">
    Time passed. 
    <br>
    Waiting felt like an eternity, <span>until one of the blue doors opened and a tall man in long white coat stepped out.
    </span>   
    </div>

    <div id="slide5" class="yell">
    "Kaira!" that man shouted.
